# hey 👋

designer and developer running [SendGrowth](https://sendgrowth.com). i build products from concept to production—design, code, and ship.

i'm obsessed with finding new ways to leverage modern tools to solve problems. i build a lot of small, focused products that aim to do one thing really well.

## what i'm into

iterating with customers directly.

AI-powered automation. building tools that take tedious workflows and make them instant.

edge computing patterns. distributed systems, real-time workflows, scalable caching.

product design. clean, focused interfaces that solve specific problems.

rapid shipping. turning ideas into working products fast.

## stack

whatever gets the job done fastest. right now: edge workers, durable objects, websockets, svelte, AI APIs.

## featured projects

check out my pinned repos for production-ready patterns in distributed systems and edge computing.
